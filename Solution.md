SEASPAN FERRY SCHEDULE VISUALIZATION
===================================

## INTRODUCTION

SEASPAN Ferries needs an efficient visualization table which could enable them to understand the following:
  * What Each Vessel is doing at any given time, it's occupancy (Vehicle and Passenger) and direction it's travelling.
  * The availablity of berths in the ports.
  
The below are the Constraints that we need to understand while making changes to the schedule:
 * A ship has travel time, cannot teleport, cannot carry more passengers than its capacity.
 * A ship cannot dock when no berths are available in the ports.
 
We have the below Assumptions:
 *
